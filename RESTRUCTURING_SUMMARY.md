# Project Restructuring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the restructuring of the MosyChat project to split large page files into smaller, reusable components, custom hooks, and utility functions.

## Files Restructured

### 1. Knowledge Base Detail Page (`app/dashboard/knowledge-base/[id]/page.tsx`)
**Original size:** 882 lines → **New size:** 6 lines

#### New Structure:
- **Hook:** `hooks/use-knowledge-base-detail.ts` (200+ lines)
- **Types:** `components/pages/knowledge-base/types.ts` (40+ lines)
- **Components:**
  - `components/pages/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-detail.tsx` (120+ lines)
  - `components/pages/knowledge-base/upload-modal.tsx` (100+ lines)
  - `components/pages/knowledge-base/document-table.tsx` (150+ lines)

#### Benefits:
- Separated business logic into custom hook
- Reusable upload modal component
- Reusable document table component
- Centralized type definitions
- Better testability and maintainability

### 2. Knowledge Base List Page (`app/dashboard/knowledge-base/page.tsx`)
**Original size:** 478 lines → **New size:** 6 lines

#### New Structure:
- **Hook:** `hooks/use-knowledge-base-list.ts` (60+ lines)
- **Components:**
  - `components/pages/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-list.tsx` (80+ lines)
  - `components/pages/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-table.tsx` (80+ lines)
  - `components/pages/knowledge-base/add-knowledge-base-dialog.tsx` (70+ lines)
  - `components/pages/knowledge-base/edit-knowledge-base-name-dialog.tsx` (70+ lines)
  - `components/pages/knowledge-base/edit-knowledge-base-users-dialog.tsx` (100+ lines)
  - `components/pages/knowledge-base/edit-knowledge-base-groups-dialog.tsx` (100+ lines)

#### Benefits:
- Separated dialog components for better reusability
- Centralized state management in custom hook
- Reusable table component
- Better separation of concerns

## New Directory Structure

│   └── knowledge-base/
│       ├── types.ts
│       ├── knowledge-base-detail.tsx

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic moved to custom hooks
- UI components separated from data management
- Type definitions centralized

### 2. **Reusability**
- Dialog components can be reused across different pages
- Table components are generic and reusable
- Upload modal can be used in other contexts

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- Clear separation between different functionalities
- Better error handling and loading states

### 4. **Testability**
- Custom hooks can be tested independently
- UI components can be tested in isolation
- Business logic is separated from UI

### 5. **Performance**
- Components can be optimized individually
- Better code splitting opportunities
- Reduced bundle size for individual pages

## Remaining Files to Restructure

The following large files still need to be restructured:

1. **Users Page** (`app/dashboard/users/page.tsx`) - 380 lines
2. **Groups Page** (`app/dashboard/groups/page.tsx`) - 372 lines  
3. **Agents Page** (`app/dashboard/agents/page.tsx`) - 439 lines
4. **Feedbacks Page** (`app/dashboard/feedbacks/page.tsx`) - 519 lines

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Continue with Users Page**: Create `hooks/use-users.ts` and `components/pages/users/`
2. **Continue with Groups Page**: Create `hooks/use-groups.ts` and `components/pages/groups/`
3. **Continue with Agents Page**: Create `hooks/use-agents.ts` and `components/pages/agents/`
4. **Continue with Feedbacks Page**: Create `hooks/use-feedbacks.ts` and `components/pages/feedbacks/`

## Benefits Achieved

- **Reduced file sizes**: From 800+ lines to 6 lines for main pages
- **Better organization**: Clear separation of components, hooks, and types
- **Improved maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- **Enhanced reusability**: Components can be used across different pages
- **Better developer experience**: Smaller files are easier to navigate and understand

## Code Quality Improvements

- **Type safety**: Centralized type definitions
- **Error handling**: Consistent error handling patterns
- **Loading states**: Proper loading state management
- **Accessibility**: Better component structure for screen readers
- **Performance**: Optimized re-renders and state updates
